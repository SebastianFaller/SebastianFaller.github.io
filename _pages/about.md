I am currently doing a PhD at IBM Research Europe in Rüschlikon, ZH and at ETH Zürich. I am very lucky to have Dr. Julia Hesse and Prof. Dennis Hofheinz as my supervisors.

My research interests are Oblivious Pseudo-Random Functions, Password-Authenticated Key Exchange and everything that relates to those topics.
